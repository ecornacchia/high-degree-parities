This a short description of the files in the repository:
- main.py: contains the main code used to run the experiments.
- main_alignment.py: contains the code used to estimate the GAL with Montecarlo.
- models.py: contains the models used in the experiments, along with the different initializations.
- examples.py: contains the target tasks used in the experiments.
- utilities.py: contains additional functions.
- run.sh: contains example code for running the main experiments.
- GAL_corr_oneneuon.py: contains the code for numerically approximating the GAL on a one-neuron network, with correlation loss.
- GAL_hinge_oneneuron.ipynb: contains the code for numerically approximating the GAL on a one-neuron network, with hinge loss.
- corr_loss_output_layer_training.ipynb: contains the code for the experiments supporting our theoretical positive result (i.e. output layer training with the correlation loss).
